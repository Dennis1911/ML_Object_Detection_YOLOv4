# ML_Object_Detection_YOLOv4


## Wildlife Detection Project using YOLOv4
### Overview
This project aims to leverage the capabilities of the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once, Version 4) object detection model to identify and count wildlife species such as giraffes, zebras, and elephants. It's designed to assist in wildlife conservation efforts by automating the process of animal detection in various habitats.

### Features
Pre-trained YOLOv4 Model: Utilizes a robust and accurate object detection model pre-trained on a comprehensive dataset.
Wildlife Detection: Specifically tailored to detect giraffes, zebras, and elephants.
Image Processing: Automated processing of images from a designated folder.
Results Storage: Saves detection outputs in a separate folder for easy analysis and review.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow (compatible with YOLOv4)
OpenCV-Python
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt


## Customization
You can customize the detection settings, such as the confidence threshold and NMS (Non-Max Suppression) threshold, in the wildlife_detection.py script.
